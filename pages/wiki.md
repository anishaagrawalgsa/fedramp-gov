Within the FedRAMP Security Assessment Framework, once an authorization has been granted, the CSP’s security posture is monitored according to the assessment and authorization process. Monitoring security controls is part of the overall risk management framework for information security and the CPS is required to maintain a security authorization that meets the FedRAMP requirements.

Traditionally, this process has been referred to as “Continuous Monitoring” as noted in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST SP) 800-137 Information Security Continuous Monitoring for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Other NIST documents such as NIST SP 800-37, Revision 1 refer to “ongoing assessment of security controls.” It is important to note that both the terms “Continuous Monitoring” and “Ongoing Security Assessments” mean essentially the same thing and should be interpreted as such.

Performing ongoing security assessments determines whether the set of deployed security controls in a cloud information system remains effective in light of new exploits and attacks, and planned and unplanned changes that occur in the system and its environment over time. To maintain an authorization that meets the FedRAMP requirements, the CSP must monitor their security controls, assess them on a regular basis, and demonstrate that the security posture of their service offering is continuously acceptable.

Ongoing assessment of security controls results in greater control over the security posture of the CSP system and enables timely risk-management decisions. Security-related information collected through continuous monitoring is used to make recurring updates to the security assessment package. Ongoing due diligence and review of security controls enables the security authorization package to remain current which allows agencies to make informed risk management decisions as they use cloud services.


The below information provides CSPs with guidance and instructions on how to implement their continuous monitoring program. Certain deliverables and artifacts related to continuous monitoring that FedRAMP requires from CSPs are discussed below as well.

<h2>Continuous Monitoring Process </h2>
The FedRAMP continuous monitoring program is based on the continuous monitoring process described in NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring for Federal Information Systems and Organization. The goal is to provide: (i) operational visibility; (ii) managed change control; and (iii) attendance to incident response duties. For more information on incident response, review the FedRAMP Incident Communications Procedure.
					
The effectiveness of a CSP’s continuous monitoring capability supports ongoing authorization and reauthorization decisions. Security-related information collected during continuous monitoring is used to make updates to the security authorization package. Updated documents provide evidence that FedRAMP baseline security controls continue to safeguard the system as originally planned.	

As defined by NIST, the process for continuous monitoring includes the following initiatives:
<ul>
<li><strong>Define</strong> a continuous monitoring strategy based on risk tolerance that maintains clear visibility into assets and awareness of vulnerabilities and utilizes up-to-date threat information.</li>
<li><strong>Establishz</strong> measures, metrics, and status monitoring and control assessments frequencies that make known organizational security status and detect changes to information system infrastructure and environments of operation, and status of security control effectiveness in a manner that supports continued operation within acceptable risk tolerances.</li>
<li><strong>Implement</strong> a continuous monitoring program to collect the data required for the defined measures and report on findings; automate collection, analysis, and reporting of data where possible.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong> the data gathered and Report findings accompanied by recommendations. It may become necessary to collect additional information to clarify or supplement existing monitoring data.</li>
<li><strong>Respond</strong> to assessment findings by making decisions to either mitigate technical, management, and operational vulnerabilities, or accept the risk; or transfer it to another authority.</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong> and Update the monitoring program, revising the continuous monitoring strategy and maturing measurement capabilities to increase visibility into assets and awareness of vulnerabilities; further enhance data-driven control of the security of an organization’s information infrastructure; and increase organizational flexibility.</li>
</ul>
